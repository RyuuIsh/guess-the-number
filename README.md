# guess-the-number
A fun and interactive Python game where players try to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts. Choose your difficulty level and challenge your intuition!

## Features
- Random Number Generation: The game selects a random number between 1 and 100 for each round.
- Two Difficulty Levels:
-- Easy Mode: 10 attempts to guess the number.
